# Retail Node Installer (RNI)

## Introduction

The Retail Node Installer (RNI) is a collection of scripts that enables network-wide [PXE](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24628_01/em.121/e27046/appdx_pxeboot.htm#EMLCM12198) booting of customizable operating systems, referred to as "profiles". It has a lightweight footprint, requiring only Bash, Docker, and Docker Compose. Profiles can be any typical Linux distribution, such as RancherOS, Ubuntu, Clear Linux.

The main executable to setup a device as a Retail Node Installer is `build.sh`. This script will automatically build a few Docker images, download necessary files as required by profiles, prepare the PXE boot menu, and launch the following dockerized services:

  - **dnsmasq** (provides DHCP and TFTP services)

  - **nginx**

  - **squid** - optional, used for caching http requests

  - **registry** - optional, used for caching Docker images

[RancherOS](https://github.com/intel/rni-profile-base-rancheros), [Clear Linux](https://github.com/intel/rni-profile-base-clearlinux) and [Ubuntu](https://github.com/intel/rni-profile-base-ubuntu) are provided as example profiles.

This document will guide you through the following:

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

1. [Setting up your Network](#network-setup)

1. [Installing the Retail Node Installer (RNI)](#installing-the-rni)

1. [Building Target Devices](#building-target-devices)

1. [Profile Management](#profile-management)

## Prerequisites

The following is required:

* **Profile** - The git URL for at least one profile is required. You will be asked to paste the URL into the configuration file in the following instructions.

* **Retail Node Installer** - Minimum Recommended Hardware or VM with 2 CPUs, 20GB HD and 2GB of RAM, running any Linux Distro (headless recommended) that supports Docker
  * `docker` 18.09.3 or greater
  * `docker-compose` v1.23.2 or greater (use [the official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
  * `bash` v4.3.48 or greater

* **Target Device(s)** - Bare-Metal or Virtual Machine(s) with the necessary specifications for your use case. The profile defines what will we be installed on the Target Device. _Note: The Target Devices will be wiped clean during typical usage of the Retail Node Installer._

## Network Setup

The Retail Node Installer must have a static IPv4 address. Additionally, Retail Node Installer must be the only DHCP server on the network. This means that any existing routers/gateway/switches that are acting as DHCP servers must have their DHCP-serving functionality disabled.

Because RNI is OS-agnostic and Docker-based, the configuration of your system's network is not something that this guide will cover.

Target Devices will be connected on the same LAN as the Retail Node Installer. On target devices, enable PXE Boot in the BIOS if it is not enabled. Most BIOS's have a boot menu option (F12) at POST time. Typically you can press (F12) to alter the boot sequence.

## Installing the RNI

Once the prerequisites and network setup have been taken care of, the steps to deployment are as follows.

**Step 1.**

Clone the Retail Node Installer repository using your git protocol of choice, and navigate into the cloned directory - use the following code snippet as an example:

```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/intel/retail-node-installer.git retail-node-installer
cd retail-node-installer
```

**Step 2.**

Copy `conf/config.sample.yml` to `conf/config.yml`:

```bash
cp conf/config.sample.yml conf/config.yml
```

The config file can look something like this - **please modify the values below, this is not intended to be a working example**:

```yaml
---

dhcp_range_minimum: 192.168.1.100
dhcp_range_maximum: 192.168.1.250
network_broadcast_ip: 192.168.1.255
network_gateway_ip: 192.168.1.1
network_dns_secondary: 8.8.8.8
host_ip: 192.168.1.11

profiles:
  - git_remote_url: https://github.com/intel/rni-profile-base-clearlinux.git
    profile_branch: legacy
    profile_base_branch: None
    git_username: ""
    git_token: ""
    name: clearlinux_profile
    custom_git_arguments: --depth=1
    
  - git_remote_url: https://github.com/intel/rni-profile-base-clearlinux.git
    profile_branch: desktop
    profile_base_branch: master
    git_username: ""
    git_token: ""
    name: clearlinux_profile
    custom_git_arguments: --depth=1

```

Make changes according to your needs, including your GitHub username and [token](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) if needed (using a password is not recommended for security reasons), with the following guidance:

  * Public repositories that do not require a username and token/password **must** have the values of `git_username=""` and `git_token=""`
  * Under the `profiles` section, update the git remote to match the HTTPS-based `git remote` URL for your profile. Also update git remote branch by setting `profile_branch` and if it requires any base branch then update it by setting `profile_base_branch` for your profile else set `profile_base_branch` as **None**
  * Ensure that the network configuration matches your needs. If values are not specified, Retail Node Installer will default to a `/24` network with a DHCP range of `x.x.x.100-x.x.x.250`.
  * For special situations, custom git flags can be added on the fly by setting `custom_git_arguments`. It _must_ be defined (see next bullet point), so if no custom git flags are needed, specify `None` or `""`.
  * Every profile must have **all** values defined in the config. For example, you cannot remove `custom_git_arguments`; you must specify a value. This is a [known limitation](#known-limitations).
  * The `name` of the profile will appear as a boot menu option on the target device's PXE menu. It can be any alphanumeric string.

**Step 3.**

Run `./build.sh` as root from the root folder. This script will perform various tasks, such as downloading files for the configured profiles in `conf/config.yml`, generating a PXE boot menu, and other things. Depending on the profiles you've selected, the build process can take a few minutes, and is hands-off.

**Step 4.**

Run `./run.sh` as root. This will start the Retail Node Installer services. _It is safe to press `ctrl+C` to quit out of logging safely at any time._

**Retail Node Installer has now been deployed successfully!** The next step is to [build a target device](#building-target-devices), which is detailed just below.

## Building Target Devices

**Booting Target Devices**

1. Make sure the Retail Node Installer is the only active DHCP server in your LAN. If you have not already, disable DHCP on the router, switch, or any other network interface in your LAN.

2. Boot the target device while connected to your LAN. Make sure you boot this device from network instead of local disk or cd-rom. This will initiate the PXE boot of your target device from the Retail Node Installer.

3. After installation, the device will reboot. Manually select the local disk boot option in the PXE menu when it comes up. If the terminal comes up without an error message and notification to check the error log, then it has built successfully!

## Post-deployment Information

**Flags**

Users can get a list of all flags supported by running `./build.sh -h`

**Troubleshooting the Retail Node Installer**

Log information is available in `rni.log` in the root folder. In order to monitor the logs you can run `docker-compose logs -f`

If it becomes necessary to delete the Retail Node Installer containers and re-create them, run `./run.sh -f` (assuming there are no target devices in your network that are attempting to boot while running this command).

You can use `./run.sh -r` to restart the Retail Node Installer containers.

For any other problems that you may encounter during deployment, please consult the [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) section.

## Profile Management

This section is not required for setting up an Retail Node Installer and building target devices, but it provides valuable information about profiles, templating, and file downloads that will help you build your own profiles.

**Kernel arguments** can be specified in a file called `conf/config.yml` _in the profile's repository_, **not in Retail Node Installer itself**, like this:

```yaml
---

kernel_arguments: rancher.cloud_init.datasources=[url:http://@@HOST_IP@@/profile/@@PROFILE_NAME@@/dyn-ks.yml]
```

Variables surrounded by `@@` symbols are handled by the templating engine in Retail Node Installer. Please read [Templating](#templating) for more information on this topic.

### Templating

Retail Node Installer has a few essential templating capabilies that assist with profile configuration.

In a profile's `conf/config.yml`, for the `kernel_arguments` variable only, the following template variables are supported:

* `@@DHCP_MIN@@` - `dhcp_range_minimum`
* `@@DHCP_MAX@@` - `dhcp_range_maximum`
* `@@NETWORK_BROADCAST_IP@@` - `network_broadcast_ip`
* `@@NETWORK_GATEWAY_IP@@` - `network_gateway_ip`
* `@@HOST_IP@@` - `host_ip`
* `@@NETWORK_DNS_SECONDARY@@` - `network_dns_secondary`

Any file with the suffix `.rnitemplate` in a profile will support all of the above as well as:

* `@@PROFILE_NAME@@`

### Profile Build Scripts

A profile can contain a `build.sh` script (must have executable flags set) that will be executed locally on the builder host before anything else. Templating is also supported, so `build.sh.buildertemplate` files will be processed (as described in the [Templating](#templating) section) and then executed on the builder host itself.

These `build.sh` scripts can be useful for any sort of pre-processing task. One use case might be to download a `.tar.gz` file that contains and `initrd` and `linux` kernel files, extract them, and then host them locally so that the builder host can process them.

### File Downloads and Dependencies

A profile will likely require external files in order to boot and install. This is solved by specifying them in `conf/files.yml` _inside the profile repository_, **not in Retail Node Installer itself**. For an example, please see the `files.yml.sample` in the Rancher profile.

### Custom Profiles

* A custom profile can be developed and used with existing base profiles.
  * Base profile will have core logic of installing OS. Please see `pre.sh` script in ClearLinux profile on `base` branch.
  * Base profile will also `post.sh` script for clean up activities. Please see `post.sh` script in ClearLinux profile on `base` branch.
  * Custom profile can have `profile.sh` to support custom features. Please see `profile.sh` script in ClearLinux profile on `rwo` branch.
  * Finally custom profile will have `bootstrap.sh` which will eventually call `pre.sh` from *base* branch, `profile.sh` from *custom* branch and then call `post.sh` from *base* branch again. Please see `bootstrap.sh` script in ClearLinux profile on `rwo` branch.
* To see more details on how to change Edgebuilder configuration to use custom profile, see *step 2*
under [Installation](#installation)

## Known Limitations

* The `conf/config.yml` file must specify ALL values comprehensively, as shown in the `conf/config.sample.yml`. Please use `""` for empty values.
* IPv6 is not supported.
* Retail Node Installer must be run on a Linux-native file system, such as `ext4`. Filesystems that cannot properly preserve file permissions are not supported.
* On some distributions of Linux (such as newer versions of Ubuntu 18.04), `systemd-resolved` is already running a DNS server on `localhost`. This will cause the dnsmasq container (which is required) to fail to start due to port binding conflicts. To fix this:
  * Run `./build.sh` normally. It will fail at the final deployment step.
  * Edit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` to include the line `DNSStubListener=no`
  * **This step will cause your network connection to drop.** Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service`
  * Run `./run.sh` to restart the Retail Node Installer services.
  * Test that network connectivity works.
  * Proceed to deploy your target devices.
* Retail Node Installer's usage of `aws-cli` can cause keyring issues on desktop versions of Linux. Consider disabling your distro's keyring service, or alternatively, a headless distribution such as Ubuntu server edition will resolve the issue.

## Other Info

You can build behind a proxy like this:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.site.com:1234 && \
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.site.com:1234 && \
./build.sh
```
